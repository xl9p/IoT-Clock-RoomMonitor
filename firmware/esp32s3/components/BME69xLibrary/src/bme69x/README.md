> Bosch Sensortec's BME690 SensorAPI

## Sensor Overview
BME690 is an integrated environmental sensor developed specifically for mobile applications and wearables where size and low power consumption are key requirements. Expanding Bosch Sensortec’s existing family of environmental sensors, the BME690 integrates for the first time high-linearity and high-accuracy gas, pressure, humidity and temperature sensors. It consists of an 8-pin metal-lid 3.0 x 3.0 x 0.93 mm³ LGA package which is designed for optimized consumption depending on the specific operating mode, long term stability and high EMC robustness. The gas sensor within the BME690 can detect a broad range of gases to measure air quality for personal well being. Gases that can be detected by the BME690 include Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) from paints (such as formaldehyde), lacquers, paint strippers, cleaning supplies, furnishings, office equipment, glues, adhesives and alcohol.
